[SPEAKER: Bhaskar]
Welcome to another episode of Bhaskar Bose. Today, we delve into the mysterious disappearance of Ramesh Sharma.
[SFX: thunder]
A case that has left the entire city of Banaras in shock.

[SPEAKER: Mishra]
This case doesn't make sense, Bhaskar. The man vanished from a locked room, with guards outside.
[SFX: ghat]
How is this even possible?

[SPEAKER: Bhaskar]
Yes, but I can feel there's something here, deep within the ancient streets of Banaras.
[SFX: heartbeat]
The answer lies not in what we can see, but what remains hidden from plain sight.

[SPEAKER: Mishra]
What do you mean? The room was thoroughly searched...

[SPEAKER: Bhaskar]
Sometimes, Mishra, the clues are hidden in the sacred waters of the Ganges itself.
[SFX: water]
Let's visit the ghat where Ramesh was last seen before his disappearance.

[SPEAKER: Mishra]
You think there's a connection?

[SPEAKER: Bhaskar]
Everything in Banaras is connected, Mishra. The ancient and the modern, the sacred and the profane.
[SFX: temple_bells]
I believe we'll find our answers at dawn.
